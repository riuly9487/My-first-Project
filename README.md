By the date of today, I have self-taught myself Javascript, CSS, and HTML5 courses provided by SuperSimpleDev and Mimo Apps. <br/>
Javascript: 2024/09/27 ~ 2024/10/25 <br/>
CSS&HTML5: 2024/10/25 ~ 2024/11/01 <br/>

It feels rushed and I understand it, I will continue to enhance my soft skills to make my code better.  <br/>

Thank you anyone for coming by, and again, I'm definitely a rookie in coding, give me time to lift my wings up. <br/>
